GenderIdentification_MachineLearning
====================================

Gender identification has been used in many different acoustic applications for a long time. Most speech recognition applications consist of two parts. First part is called training and the second part is called testing. In the training mode, MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients) which is a well-known speech extraction feature will be applied on the male and female speech data. Then VQ (vector quantization) which is a speech classifier algorithm will be applied on the signal to model the female and male speech. In the test mode a comparison will be made between trained data and the unknown data and gender of the speech will be identified.
